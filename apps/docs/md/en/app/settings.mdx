# Settings Page

---

The page with the `/settings` prefix is exclusively for the **_current user_**—that is, the user who is currently logged in. Each parameter (`params`) in the URL is used to review, update, or delete data based on that account. Currently, there is only one active parameter, based on the `username`, which functions to update user data according to UX needs and YouApp team specifications.

## &#91;username&#93;

This parameter is taken from the `username` value of each user. Therefore, in the database, the `username` field in the `User` model has a **unique** constraint. This page allows users to view and update data structurally through several **card** displays, including:

### First Card

---

The first card will display several pieces of information such as:

- **Profile photo**
- **Name**
- **Gender**
- **Horoscope (western zodiac)**
- **Zodiac (Chinese shio)**

For **Horoscope Badge** and **Zodiac Badge**, users can click on the element to display detailed information according to the date and year of birth entered.

#### Reference Data:

- **Zodiac (Shio)** is obtained through safe scraping methods from the [yourchineseastrology.com](https://www.yourchineseastrology.com) website, using [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/intro).
- **Horoscope (Western Zodiac)** is obtained through the public API from [API Ninjas](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/horoscope) using HTTP fetch (requires `NINJAS_PUBLIC_KEY`).

#### UX Enhancement:

When the screen width exceeds 768px (assuming a _notebook_ query) and the user does not yet have a profile photo, the user can **drag & drop** directly into the card to upload a new image.

### Second Card

---

The second card is used to update user personal information simultaneously:

- **Profile Photo** <br />
  Optional. Media files (`.jpg`, `.gif`, `.mp4`) will be stored on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), and the database stores them as URLs. <br />
  If the user registers using a third-party service (e.g., Google), the photo URL will be taken from the relevant provider.

- **Name** <br />
  Users can update their name with a minimum of two characters. If it consists of more than one word, the name will be mapped to the `firstName` and `lastName` fields in the database. <br />
  Example: `Alexander Immanuel Johndoe` → `firstName = Alexander`, `lastName = Immanuel Johndoe`.

- **Gender** <br />
  Users can adjust their gender according to the available options.
  Available gender options are `Male` and `Female`.

- **Date of Birth** <br />
  Used for:
  - Internal validation.
  - `Horoscope` and `Zodiac` calculation. <br />
    _Note: If `birthDate` is `null` or `undefined`, neither will be displayed._

- **Zodiac (Chinese Shio)** <br />
  - Calculated based on birth date-month-year.
  - Supports:
    - Shio cycle calculation up to **2043-02-10**.
    - `animals` and `elements` categories.
    - Descriptive information.
    - Corresponding icon display.

- **Horoscope (Western Zodiac)** <br />
  - Calculated based on birth date-month.
  - Brief info, and informative display.
  - Corresponding icon display.

- **Height** <br />
  A numerical value, expressed in **centimeters (cm)**. _Asian users friendly._

- **Weight** <br />
  A numerical value, expressed in **kilograms (kg)**.

### Third Card

---

This card displays the user's **Interest** list.
When the user clicks the `✏️` `(pencil/edit)` icon, the card will expand and display the interest input. Changes are made with a smooth animation (stretch/expand effect).
Users can choose from suitable interest options or add, change, or delete their interests.

### Fourth Card

---

Used to update the user's **Password**.
The password form requires the user's current password for account validation. There are `Password Requirements` to guide users in creating new passwords according to the rules.

### Fifth Card

---

Users can add, change, or delete their **social media links**, such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and others.

### Sixth Card

---

The last card displays the user's **devices and login sessions**.

- Device location is determined based on user permission.
- This feature can be further developed to store session data in the database (`ping`), and allow integration with tools like [`pusher-js`](https://pusher.com/) so users can see the location or status of active sessions in real-time.
