The `auth` route is the main route used for managing user credentials. It contains a series of important page flows such as `sign in`, `sign up`, `invitation`, `verification`, and `error`, designed to handle various authentication scenarios.

Credentials are managed using [NextAuth](https://authjs.dev/), which provides support for various provider types and full customization capabilities for authentication flows.

**React Server Components (RSC)** have been fully supported since **React 18**, and fully adopted by Next.js through **Next.js 13.4** along with the launch of **App Router**. Therefore, all credential activities are implemented using functions with the `"use server"` directive. This allows functions to be executed entirely on the server side, maintaining internal visibility and security, and avoiding the traditional approach using API handlers. This approach can still be combined with client-side interactivity using `use client`.

<h4 className="text-h3 font-bold">Technical considerations:</h4>

- **Effectiveness of results**: Whether using API endpoints or server handlers, the final results are identical. However, the server handler approach offers higher execution efficiency.
- **Single-app session**: Since the session is only used within one application and not shared across applications, a public API endpoint for authentication is not required.
- **Buffering time**: Based on various testing scenarios, using server handlers results in faster transaction times for actions such as `like`, `save`, `follow`, and `credential handling`.

## Sign In

---

The `sign-in` page is used to log in to the system. Here, I only provide manual authentication (username/email + password), not through third-party providers such as `Google`, `Apple`, `GitHub`, etc. The main reasons are:

- Manual credentials give users the flexibility to choose their account name and password.
- Provider configuration requires additional setup in the company account, including additional costs for tracking.

However, if needed, provider credentials can be easily enabled as their support is already prepared in the application structure.

```tsx
function LoginWithProviders() {
  const providers = [
    { name: "google", icon: GoogleIcon },
    { name: "github", icon: GithubIcon }
  ];

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Header>
        <Title>Or continue with</Title>
      </Header>
      <Content>
        {providers.map(provider => (
          <Button key={provider.name} onClick={() => signIn(provider.name, { callbackUrl: "/" })}>
            <provider.icon className="mr-2 size-5" />
            Login with {transform(provider.name)}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </Content>
    </Wrapper>
  );
}
```

### Form Execution

- **Identifier Field** <br />
  The `Enter Username/Email` field supports automatic detection of input type (username or email) through a simple identification function.

```ts
function isEmail(identifier: string): boolean;
```

This function verifies if the input matches the email format. If not, it will be considered a username.

- **User Search** <br />
  Based on the identification results:

```ts
function getUserByEmail(email: string): Promise<Account | null>;
function getUserByUserName(username: string): Promise<Account | null>;
```

Both functions are wrapped in a single aggregate function:

```ts
function getUserByIdentifier(identifier: string): Promise<Account | null>;
```

This function searches for an account by `email` or `username` uniquely. Once an account is found, login will still be performed using the `email` of that account. _Note: email and username must be unique among users._

- **Password Field** <br />
  This feature includes:
  - Visibility toggle (`show/hide`) <br />
    Users can hide or show the password as needed (default: `hide`).
  - Real-time validation: <br />
    A `<Dropdown>` component will appear when the user starts filling the password field. <br />
    Validation includes: <br />
    1. Character length
    2. Uppercase letters
    3. Lowercase letters
    4. Numbers, and
    5. Special characters.
  - Hashing <br/>
    Validated passwords will be sent to the server side in a hashed format. Password hashing uses [bcrypt.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs).

- **Login Button** <br />
  The login button is inactive by default until all fields are filled. Once valid, the button will become active with a color transition animation.

- **Reset Password** <br />
  This feature allows users to reset their password via email. The `Reset Password` form appears as an inline form on the same page (`/auth/sign-in`) without navigation. The form only requires an email to send OTP using services like Resend. <br />
  _Note: Currently this button is a placeholder._

- **Register Here** <br />
  This button directs users to `/auth/sign-up`. <br />
  _Note: Authentication using providers does not require a sign-up page._
