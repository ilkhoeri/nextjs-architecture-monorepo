# Contributing

> âš  The default branch is `main`.

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's few guidelines that should help you as you prepare
your contribution.

## Initial steps

Before you start working on a contribution, create an issue describing what you want to build. It's possible someone else is already working on something similar, or perhaps there is a reason that feature isn't implemented. The maintainers will point you in the right direction.

### Documentation

The documentation lives in the README.md. Be sure to document any changes you implement.

### Commands

**`Installation`**

```bash
bun install
```

## License

By contributing your code to the ilkhoeri GitHub repository, you agree to
